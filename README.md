Currency Converter Description:

Objective: The goal of this project is to develop a simple currency converter that enables users to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.

Real-Time Exchange Rates: The currency converter accesses real-time exchange rate data from reliable sources such as financial APIs (e.g., Open Exchange Rates, Fixer.io, or CurrencyLayer). This ensures that conversion rates are accurate and up-to-date.

User Input: Users can input the amount of currency they wish to convert and select the currencies they want to convert from and to. This provides flexibility for users to convert between any two supported currencies.

Currency Selection: The converter supports a wide range of currencies from around the world, including major currencies like USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, etc., as well as less common currencies.

Conversion Calculation: Upon receiving user input, the converter calculates the converted amount based on the selected currencies and the real-time exchange rate. Conversion is performed accurately, considering factors such as decimal precision and rounding rules.

Bi-Directional Conversion: The currency converter allows for bi-directional conversion, meaning users can convert from one currency to another and vice versa. This enhances usability and convenience for users.

Historical Exchange Rates (Optional): Optionally, the converter may offer the ability to retrieve historical exchange rates for a specific date in the past. This feature can be useful for analyzing currency trends or performing historical conversions.

Error Handling: The converter includes robust error handling mechanisms to handle cases such as invalid inputs, network errors when fetching exchange rates, or unsupported currency pairs
